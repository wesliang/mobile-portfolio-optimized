## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Optimization of this online portfolio [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884). In particular, optimized the critical rendering path and made this page render as quickly as possible using devtools.

### Getting started

You can view the site live from here: https://wesliang.github.io/mobile-portfolio-optimized/

#### Installation

Some useful tips to get up and running:

1. Clone / Download Zip
1. Unpack to desired location and run from index.html
1. You can also run on localhost 8080 as shown below:

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)
